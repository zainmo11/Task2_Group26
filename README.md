### Welcome to Digital Logic Circuit Simplifier

To use this program, consider the following:
  - Use '&' for AND, '|' for OR, and '!' for NOT.
  - Pay attention to parentheses, e.g., (((!(A|!B)) & (A & B) ) & C) , (A | !(A))
If there is one input, it will be placed in the Input 1 column in the truth table.
If there are two inputs like A, B, then A will be in Input 2 and B will be in Input 1 (shifted left).

The logical expression for Team 26's circuit is (((!(A|!B)) & (A & B) ) & C)
